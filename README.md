## TypeScript Playground Plugin

A simple Typescript Playground Plugin to invoke [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)

It's currently intentionally very simple, but may support more options later.

## Running this plugin

- Open up the TypeScript Playground
- Go the "Plugins" in the sidebar
- Look for "Plugins from npm"
- Add `ts-playground-plugin-prettier`
- Reload the browser

Then it will show up as a tab in the sidebar.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full details, however, TLDR:

```sh
git clone ...
yarn install
yarn start
```

Then tick the box for starting plugin development inside the TypeScript Playground.
